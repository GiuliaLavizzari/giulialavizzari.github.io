# Vector Boson Scattering (VBS)
VBS takes place when quarks from different protons radiate vector bosons, which in turn interact.

It is an ideal place for searches for new physics because it is **sensitive to modifications of the EWK sector**.

## Same Sign WW scattering:
We used MC generations @LO, @parton-level of SSWW scattering with fully leptonic final state:
