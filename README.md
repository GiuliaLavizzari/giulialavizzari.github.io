VBS takes place when quarks from different protons radiate vector bosons, which in turn interact:
- It is an ideal place for searches for new physics because it is **sensitive to modifications of the EWK sector**.
- We used MC generations @LO, @parton-level of **Same Sign WW scattering(SSWW)** with fully leptonic final state:

## SM Effective Field Theories (SMEFT)
The SM is seen as a **low energy approximation of an unknown theory** and BSM effects are parametrized as additional terms to the SM lagrangian through operators of order larger than four:

This stuy is focused on 15 dim 6 operators chosen from the Warsaw Basis, which modify the distributions of the variables as follows:
